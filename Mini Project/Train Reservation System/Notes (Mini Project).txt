*  Our backend SQL system flawlessly handles various tasks:
	1. Deducting funds from users' wallet balances during transactions.
	2. Updating seat availability instantly when users book tickets.
	3. Quickly processing refunds and adjusting wallet balances accordingly.
	4. Adding seats back to availability when users cancel tickets.

*  Notably, there's an issue:

	1. The console isn't reflecting changes in wallet balances and seat availability upon ticket bookings.

Despite this, the system generally performs well.
